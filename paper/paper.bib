  abstract = {The probability distributions of bouts of licking and pauses between them in rats ingesting sucrose solutions were studied to determine if the durations of these ingestive and noningestive acts were controlled by a deterministic or probabilistic decision rule in the central nervous system. The duration of the bouts of licking could be modeled by a Poisson process, indicating that these bouts were terminated by a probabilistic rule. Three different types of pauses terminated the bouts of licking. Each averaged 0.3, 1.5, or 50-60 s in duration. The two longer pauses could be modeled by a Poisson process, indicating that their termination was also probabilistic in nature. The shorter pauses averaging 0.3 s could not and are more likely deterministically controlled.},

The analysis revealed that the licking behavior of rats is organized into bursts of licking at a high rate. These bursts occurred in clusters that were separated by brief (250--500 msec) interruptions. The clusters were separated by intervals that ranged from 500 msec to many hundreds of seconds. Sham feeding increased the length of the meal by increasing the number but not the size of the clusters. Increasing the concentration of sucrose increased monotonically the size of the clusters but varied the number of clusters as an inverted-V-shaped function. Analysis revealed the details of the central nervous system's (CNS) control over ingestive behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Ingestive behavior is controlled by multiple distinct peripheral and central physiological mechanisms that ultimately determine whether a particular food should be accepted or avoided. As rodents consume a fluid they display stereotyped rhythmic tongue movements, and by analyzing the temporal distribution of pauses of licking, it is possible through analyses of licking microstructure to uncover dissociable evaluative and motivational variables that contribute to ingestive behavior. The mean number of licks occurring within each burst of licking (burst and cluster size) reflects the palatability of the consumed solution, whereas the frequency of initiating novel bouts of licking behavior (burst and cluster number) is dependent upon the degree of gastrointestinal inhibition that accrues through continued fluid ingestion. This review describes the analysis of these measures within a context of the behavioral variables that come to influence the acceptance or avoidance of a fluid, and the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie alterations in the temporal distribution of pauses of licks. The application of these studies to models of obesity in animals is also described.},

  abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Injections of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists suppress food intake, and endogenous GLP-1 is released when nutrients enter the gut. There is also growing evidence that the GLP-1 system is involved in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis. GLP-1R agonists suppress water intake independent of their effects on food intake. It is unknown, however, whether this suppressive effect of GLP-1R agonists extends to saline intake. Accordingly, we tested the effect of the GLP-1R agonists liraglutide (0.05~{$\mu$}g) and exendin-4 (0.05~{$\mu$}g) on water and saline intake, as stimulated either by angiotensin II (AngII) or by water deprivation with partial rehydration (WD-PR). Each agonist suppressed AngII-induced water intake; however, only exendin-4 suppressed saline intake. WD-PR-induced water and saline intakes were both attenuated by each agonist. Analysis of drinking microstructure after WD-PR found a reliable effect of the agonists on burst number. Furthermore, exendin-4 conditioned a robust taste avoidance to saccharine; however, there was no similar effect of liraglutide. To evaluate the relevance of the conditioned taste avoidance, we tested whether inducing visceral malaise by injection of lithium chloride (LiCl) suppressed fluid intake. Injection of LiCl did not suppress water or saline intakes. Overall, these results indicate that the fluid intake suppression by GLP-1R activation is not selective to water intake, is a function of post-ingestive feedback, and is not secondary to visceral malaise.},

The results revealed that in addition to an increase in the amount consumed (for saccharin and quinine but not Polycose), cluster size (an index of palatability) became larger as familiarity with the benign tastants increased. The current finding suggests that the pleasure of drinking increases as the novel, potentially dangerous tastant becomes accepted as safe.},

Although the brain regions involved in the sensory detection of sodium levels have been mapped~relatively well, data about the neural basis of the motivational properties of salt appetite, including a role for midbrain dopamine cells, have been inconclusive. Here, we employed a combination of fiber photometry, behavioral pharmacology and c-Fos immunohistochemistry to study the involvement of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system in salt appetite in rats. We observed that sodium deficiency affected the responses of dopaminergic midbrain neurons to salt tasting, suggesting that these neurons encode appetitive properties of sodium. We further observed a significant reduction in the consumption of salt after pharmacological inactivation of the nucleus accumbens (but not the medial prefrontal cortex), and microstructure analysis of licking behavior suggested that this was due to decreased motivation for, but not appreciation of salt. However, this was not dependent on dopaminergic neurotransmission in that area, as infusion of a dopamine receptor antagonist into the nucleus accumbens did not alter salt appetite. We conclude that the nucleus accumbens, but not medial prefrontal cortex, is important for the behavioral expression of salt appetite by mediating its motivational component, but that the switch in salt appreciation after sodium depletion, although detected by midbrain dopamine neurons, must arise from other areas.},

Children often forego drinking plain water and instead consume beverages such as milk or juice. What effect this may have on adult thirst responses remains an open question. To model aspects of the human condition, we bred Sprague-Dawley rats and prevented the pups from obtaining fluid other than from nursing. Pups were weaned onto either tap water, 5\% sucrose, or 0.45\% saline, and given access to only that fluid for at least 7 weeks. We then measured intake of water or sucrose/saline in one-bottle tests after mild hypertonic saline (HS) injection, or overnight fluid deprivation, and in two-bottle tests after HS injection while rats were maintained on their respective fluids, and after all subjects had only water to drink for a week. We found that sucrose- and saline-maintained rats drank less water than did controls after the HS challenge. After overnight fluid deprivation, rats maintained on saline drank less water and more saline, but there was no difference in intake between water-maintained and sucrose-maintained rats. Differences in licking patterns, including more licks/burst for sucrose by sucrose-maintained rats were detected, even in cases when total intake was not different. These data provide evidence that adult rat water intake can be reduced by exclusively drinking sucrose or saline early in life.},

Studying the role of social context on alcohol drinking is important to understand the factors that contribute to the initiation or maintenance of casual and problematic alcohol use, as well as those that may be protective. A substantial body of preclinical research has shown that social environment such as housing conditions and social rank plays an important role in alcohol consumption and preference, though the extent of these effects have been obfuscated by methodological differences and technical challenges. Robust individual differences in alcohol intake in socially housed animals are difficult to track when animals share a common fluid source. Commercial solutions are prohibitively expensive and are limited by proprietary software and hardware (including caging systems). Here we describe FARESHARE, an affordable, open-source solution for tracking fluid consumption in socially housed rats. The device uses RFID and custom hardware to individually measure and record each rat's fluid consumption and licking microstructure. Each bout is also timestamped such that the circadian effects of drinking behaviour may be analysed. We provide a validation showing the operation of the device in a two-bottle-choice alcohol-drinking paradigm over a nine-day period in four group-housed female rats. We show that FARESHARE is able to capture traditional measures such as daily intake and preference, as well as circadian effects, microstructure, and individual variations in drinking.},

Loneliness in humans has been associated with increased alcohol use, and traditional rodent drinking models involve single housing, presenting challenges for studying social enrichment. We developed LIQ PARTI (Lick Instance Quantifier with Poly-Animal RFID Tracking Integration), an open-source tool to examine home cage continuous access two-bottle choice drinking behavior in a group-housed setting, investigating the influence of sex and social isolation on ethanol consumption and bout microstructure in C57Bl/6J mice. LIQ PARTI, based on our previously developed single-housed LIQ HD system, accurately tracks drinking behavior using capacitive-based sensors and RFID technology. Group-housed female mice exhibited higher ethanol preference than males, while males displayed a unique undulating pattern of ethanol preference linked to cage changes, suggesting a potential stress or novelty-related response. Chronic ethanol intake distinctly altered bout microstructure between male and female mice, highlighting sex and social environmental influences on drinking behavior. Social isolation with the LIQ HD system amplified fluid intake and ethanol preference in both sexes, accompanied by sex- and fluid-dependent changes in bout microstructure. However, these effects largely reversed upon resocialization, indicating the plasticity of these behaviors in response to social context. Utilizing a novel group-housed home cage lickometer device, our findings illustrate the critical interplay of sex and housing conditions in voluntary alcohol drinking behaviors in C57Bl/6J mice, facilitating nuanced insights into the potential contributions to AUD etiology.},

Lickometers are typically based on electrical properties, a strategy that comes with limitations, including susceptibility to electrical interference and generation of electrical disturbances in electrophysiological measurements. While optical lickometers offer an alternative method to measure licks and quantify fluid intake in animals, they are prone to false readings and susceptibility to outside light sources. To overcome this problem, we propose a low-cost open-source lickometer that combines a restricted infrared beam defined by optical fibers, with a poke design that allows easy access to the tongue while limiting access of other body parts and external light sources. This device also includes features for detecting nose pokes and presenting visual cues during behavioral tasks. We provide validation experiments that demonstrate the optical lickometer's reliability, high-sensitivity and precision, and its application in a behavioral task, showcasing the potential of this tool to study lick microstructure in combination with other techniques, such as imaging of neural activity, in freely moving mice.},

  abstract = {In order to examine genetic influences on fluid ingestion, 20-min intake of either water or 0.1M sucrose was measured in a lickometer in 18 isogenic strains of mice, including 15 inbred strains and 3 F1 hybrid crosses. Intake and licking data were examined at a number of levels, including lick rate as defined by mean or median interlick interval, as well as several microstructural parameters (i.e. burst-pause structure). In general, strain variation for ingestive phenotypes were correlated across water and sucrose in all strains, indicating fundamental, rather than stimulus-specific, mechanisms of intake. Strain variation was substantial and robust, with heritabilities for phenotypes ranging from 0.22 to 0.73. For mean interlick interval (MPI; a measure of lick rate) strains varied continuously from 94.3 to 127.0ms, a range consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, variation among strains for microstructural traits such as burst size and number suggested that strains possess different overall ingestive strategies, with some favoring more short bursts, and others favoring fewer, long bursts. Strains also varied in cumulative intake functions, exhibiting both linear and decelerated rates of intake across the session.},

  abstract = {Intracerebroventricular administration of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptides reduces food intake and increases c-Fos in brain areas involved in the control of feeding. To discern behavioral mechanisms through which CART alters the microstructure of feeding, we injected CART-(55--102) (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 {$\mu$}g, and saline controls) into the lateral ventricle of male Sprague-Dawley rats 5 min before dark onset and, using lickometers, monitored the ingestion of an Ensure liquid diet for the first 6 h of dark. At a threshold dose of 1 {$\mu$}g, CART dose dependently 1) decreased intake of Ensure in licks; 2) decreased meal size, but did not alter meal duration or number; 3) reduced initial lick rate of meals; and 4) significantly reduced burst number, licks/burst, and licks/cluster. CART dose dependently increased interlick interval (0.5 {$\mu$}g threshold, 192 {\textpm} 4 vs. 183 {\textpm} 3 ms, control; 1 {$\mu$}g: 201 {\textpm} 1 ms; 2 {$\mu$}g: 214 {\textpm} 6 ms). These data suggest that altered oral motor function, and possibly palatability perception, may be fundamental to the anorexigenic action of CART.},

  abstract = {Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats develop obesity, hyperglycemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and do not express cholecystokinin A (CCK-A) receptors, the receptor subtype mediating the satiety actions of CCK. In short-term feeding tests, male OLETF rats were completely resistant to exogenous CCK, and their response to bombesin was attenuated. Comparisons of liquid meal consumption in OLETF and control Long-Evans Tokushima (LETO) rats demonstrated that 1) OLETF rats had greater intakes during 30-min scheduled daytime meals and significantly larger and fewer spontaneous nighttime meals and 2) although the initial rates of licking were the same, OLETF rats maintained the initial rate longer and the rate at which their licking declined was slower. In 24-h solid food access tests, OLETF rats consumed significantly more pellets than LETO controls, and this increase was attributable to significant increases in meal size. Together, these data are consistent with the interpretation that the lack of CCK-A receptors in OLETF rats results in a satiety deficit leading to increases in meal size, overall hyperphagia, and obesity.},
