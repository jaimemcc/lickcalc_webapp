  abstract = {The probability distributions of bouts of licking and pauses between them in rats ingesting sucrose solutions were studied to determine if the durations of these ingestive and noningestive acts were controlled by a deterministic or probabilistic decision rule in the central nervous system. The duration of the bouts of licking could be modeled by a Poisson process, indicating that these bouts were terminated by a probabilistic rule. Three different types of pauses terminated the bouts of licking. Each averaged 0.3, 1.5, or 50-60 s in duration. The two longer pauses could be modeled by a Poisson process, indicating that their termination was also probabilistic in nature. The shorter pauses averaging 0.3 s could not and are more likely deterministically controlled.},

  abstract = {Analyzed interlick interval distribution of rats ingesting maltose under real and sham feeding conditions and while ingesting 7 concentrations of sucrose under real feeding conditions. The analysis revealed that the licking behavior of rats is organized into bursts of licking at a high rate. These bursts occurred in clusters that were separated by brief (250--500 msec) interruptions. The clusters were separated by intervals that ranged from 500 msec to many hundreds of seconds. Sham feeding increased the length of the meal by increasing the number but not the size of the clusters. Increasing the concentration of sucrose increased monotonically the size of the clusters but varied the number of clusters as an inverted-V-shaped function. Analysis revealed the details of the central nervous system's (CNS) control over ingestive behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
