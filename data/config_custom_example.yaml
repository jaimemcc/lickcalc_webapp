# lickcalc Custom Configuration Example
# This file shows how to customize default values for different research scenarios

# Session analysis defaults
session:
  # Default bin size for session histogram (seconds)
  # For longer sessions, you might want larger bins
  bin_size: 60  # Changed from 30 to 60 seconds
  # Default figure type ('hist' or 'cumul')
  fig_type: 'cumul'  # Changed to cumulative by default

# Microstructural analysis defaults
microstructure:
  # Inter-burst interval threshold (seconds)
  # For different species or experimental conditions, adjust this threshold
  interburst_interval: 1.0  # Changed from 0.5 to 1.0 seconds
  
  # Minimum licks per burst (integer)
  # Some protocols require different minimum burst sizes
  min_licks_per_burst: 3  # Changed from 1 to 3 licks
  
  # Long lick threshold (seconds)
  # Adjust based on your definition of "long licks"
  long_lick_threshold: 0.5  # Changed from 0.3 to 0.5 seconds

# File processing defaults
files:
  # Default file type for dropdown ('med', 'csv', 'dd')
  # Change if you primarily use a different file format
  default_file_type: 'csv'  # Changed from 'med' to 'csv'

# UI Configuration
ui:
  # Default window title
  title: 'lickcalc - Custom Research Lab'  # Customized title
  
  # Debug mode for development
  debug: false  # Changed to false for production use
  
  # Hot reload for development
  hot_reload: false  # Changed to false for production use

# Analysis parameters (advanced)
analysis:
  # Session bin slider configuration
  max_session_bins: 600  # Changed from 300 to 600 for longer sessions
  min_session_bins: 10   # Changed from 5 to 10
  session_bin_step: 10   # Changed from 5 to 10 second steps
  
  # Inter-burst interval slider configuration
  max_interburst_interval: 5.0  # Changed from 3.0 to 5.0 seconds
  min_interburst_interval: 0.1  # Changed from 0.0 to 0.1
  interburst_step: 0.1          # Changed from 0.25 to 0.1 for finer control
  
  # Long lick threshold slider configuration
  max_long_lick_threshold: 2.0  # Changed from 1.0 to 2.0 seconds
  min_long_lick_threshold: 0.2  # Changed from 0.1 to 0.2
  long_lick_step: 0.05          # Changed from 0.1 to 0.05 for finer control
